purescript-dygraphs
===================

Purescript bindings to [dygraphs](http://www.dygraphs.com/) plotting library.

See the linked homepage for documentation on using and configuring dygraphs.

These bindings were written for dygraphs version 1.1.1.

Examples of purescript-dygraphs in action are in the `examples` directory. The
html file will not render any graphs until the project is built with:
`pulp browserify --include src --src-path examples --optimise --to tmp/Examples.js`

`pscDocs` output is available in the `docs` directory.
